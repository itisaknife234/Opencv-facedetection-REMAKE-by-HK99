# Opencv Project Inspired By Qt Company Ltd

> 이형규(Hyeong Gyu Lee) - Hekaton99 project
> 
> Inspired by "https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/examples/example_external_opencv.html#example-external-OpenCV"
> 
> go check the original code If you are interested in
>
> 
# Intro
> This project is based on Opencv which use the built-in camera or webcam resources
> 
> Original code is the code that make square on the screen(based on camera) object what you want to detect by Opencv
> 
> There are lot's of Trained model (based on haarcascade) to detect the object (eye, frontal face, car ...etc)
>
# The Original code

> This is the Orignal code that posted
> 
> There are simple feature to change the Trained Model, stop/Close and Start
>

> Orignal code works well and good at detect the eye
> 
> The Lab environment is based on Samsung Galaxy Book2
>
# Remaked Code
> I want to add some more features like stop the moemt and let you to capture the moment

> This is the frontal page that nothing work on
> 
> I make the buttons go down by Trained model for seperate the button function
> 
> And added Detected objects feature to make user can know how many things tha Opencv detected
> 
> Now let's see the button features
> 
> ## Start : As you know, It make you to run this progam
> 
> ## Stop : It make you to stop the moment when you want to
> 
> ## Capture : I want to add this feature because It can be used to analyze the moment
>

# Working Process

> It work same as the Original code
> 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cd66b69-aba1-42c7-9a99-97b7dcc0aae0)
> and the Capture feature works well
> 
> The Capture file will be placed on the same diractory where the code file located
>
# Conclusion
> The based code was perfectlty built so remaking the program was easy
> 
> Using the Opencv and make what I intend was hard but there are some pattern and you can easly used on
> 
> I really feel the fun and enjoy to add some features
> 
> Thank you
>
# ETC
> If you make a exe file by PyInstaller, the folder named "haarcascades" will automatically generated

> Then, download the haarcascade files and place in it

> Then the Model will appear
